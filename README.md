Minor QOL fixes for SPTarkov

Tarkov is full of annoyances but we can fix them! Sometimes.

## Inventory
- Swap items in place! Drag an item over another one and they'll swap positions if possible. Items that already have an interaction with each other (e.g. bullets and magazines) are unaffected.
- Rebind Home/End, PageUp/PageDown to work like they do in every other app ever released in the history of the world.
- Customizable mouse scrolling speed

## Doors
- Remove the unimplemented actions like "Bang & clear" that, lets face it, are never going to happen anyway.

## Item bar
- Fix the keybind for weapons always showing up as 1, 2, and 3. Now shows your actual keybind like every other slot.

## Weapon presets/modding
- Enable zooming with mousewheel
- Skips needless unsaved changes warnings when navigating to another screen from a weapon preset (optional, defaults ON)
- Skip all unsaved changes warnings when closing a weapon preset (optional, defaults OFF)

## Mail
- Skips "You can return to this later" warnings when not transferring all items (optional, defaults ON)
- "Receive All" button no longer shows up when there is nothing to receive.


## More to come... ?
