Tarkov is full of annoyances but we can fix them! Sometimes.

## Confirmation dialogs
- Skips needless unsaved changes warnings when navigating to another screen from a weapon preset (optional, defaults ON)
- Skip all unsaved changes warnings when closing a weapon preset (optional, defaults OFF)
- Skips "You can return to this later" warnings when not transferring all items (optional, defaults ON)

## Mail
- "Receive All" button no longer shows up when there is nothing to receive.
